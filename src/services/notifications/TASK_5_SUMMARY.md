# Task 5 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 5: "Implement NotificationScheduler with quiet hours support" including all three subtasks.

## What Was Implemented

### 5.1 Create Scheduling Logic with Triggers ✅

**File**: `src/services/notifications/NotificationScheduler.ts`

Implemented comprehensive scheduling logic with:

1. **Daily Trigger Calculation**
   - Calculates next occurrence of daily repeating notifications
   - Handles same-day vs next-day scheduling based on current time
   - Supports custom hour and minute configuration

2. **One-Time Trigger Calculation**
   - Schedules notifications for specific dates and times
   - Validates that dates are not in the past
   - Supports both repeating and non-repeating triggers

3. **Weekly Trigger Calculation**
   - Calculates next occurrence based on target weekday
   - Handles current week vs next week scheduling
   - Supports custom hour and minute configuration

4. **Batch Scheduling**
   - `scheduleMultiple()` method for scheduling multiple notifications at once
   - Partial success handling (continues if some fail)
   - Error aggregation and reporting

5. **Trigger Validation**
   - Validates date triggers are not in the past
   - Validates hour ranges (0-23)
   - Validates minute ranges (0-59)
   - Validates weekday ranges (0-6)
   - Throws descriptive errors for invalid configurations

**Requirements Satisfied**: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2

### 5.2 Implement QuietHoursManager ✅

**File**: `src/services/notifications/QuietHoursManager.ts`

Implemented complete quiet hours management with:

1. **Configuration Management**
   - `setQuietHours()` - Configure start and end times
   - `getQuietHours()` - Retrieve current configuration
   - `disableQuietHours()` - Turn off quiet hours
   - Integration with NotificationPreferencesStore

2. **Time Checking Logic**
   - `isInQuietHours()` - Check if a time falls within quiet hours
   - Handles midnight boundary cases correctly
   - Supports quiet hours spanning midnight (e.g., 10 PM to 7 AM)
   - Supports quiet hours within same day (e.g., 1 PM to 3 PM)

3. **Time Adjustment**
   - `getNextAvailableTime()` - Calculate next available time after quiet hours
   - Adds 15-minute buffer after quiet hours end
   - Handles date rollover for midnight-spanning quiet hours

4. **Critical Notification Override**
   - `shouldOverrideQuietHours()` - Determine if notification should bypass quiet hours
   - Critical notifications: dose reminders within 1 hour
   - Respects `allowCritical` configuration flag

5. **Utility Methods**
   - Time formatting and parsing
   - Quiet hours duration calculation
   - Configuration validation
   - Human-readable descriptions
   - Overlap detection

**Requirements Satisfied**: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4

### 5.3 Integrate Quiet Hours into Scheduler ✅

**Files**:

- `src/services/notifications/NotificationScheduler.ts`
- `src/services/notifications/NotificationService.ts`

Implemented seamless integration:

1. **Automatic Quiet Hours Checking**
   - Every scheduled notification is checked against quiet hours
   - Happens transparently in `schedule()` method
   - No changes needed in calling code

2. **Automatic Time Adjustment**
   - Notifications during quiet hours are automatically deferred
   - Adjusted time is calculated using QuietHoursManager
   - Original and adjusted times are stored in notification data

3. **Critical Override Handling**
   - Critical notifications bypass quiet hours automatically
   - Based on notification type and timing
   - Configurable via quiet hours settings

4. **Metadata Storage**
   - Stores `originalTime` - when notification was originally scheduled
   - Stores `adjustedTime` - when notification will actually be delivered
   - Stores `wasAdjusted` - boolean flag indicating if time was changed

5. **NotificationService Integration**
   - Updated NotificationService to use NotificationScheduler
   - Removed duplicate scheduling logic
   - Added `reschedule()` method
   - Added `scheduleMultiple()` method

**Requirements Satisfied**: 5.2, 5.3

## Architecture

```
NotificationService (High-level API)
    ↓
NotificationScheduler (Scheduling logic)
    ↓
QuietHoursManager (Quiet hours enforcement)
    ↓
NotificationPreferencesStore (Configuration storage)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Time Adjustment

- Automatically defers notifications during quiet hours
- Adds 15-minute buffer after quiet hours end
- Preserves original scheduling intent

### 2. Midnight Boundary Handling

- Correctly handles quiet hours spanning midnight
- Example: 10 PM to 7 AM works correctly
- Time at 11 PM → in quiet hours ✓
- Time at 2 AM → in quiet hours ✓
- Time at 8 AM → not in quiet hours ✓

### 3. Critical Notification Override

- Dose reminders within 1 hour override quiet hours
- Configurable via `allowCritical` flag
- Ensures important reminders are never missed

### 4. Comprehensive Validation

- Validates all trigger configurations
- Prevents scheduling in the past
- Validates time ranges
- Provides descriptive error messages

### 5. Batch Operations

- Schedule multiple notifications efficiently
- Partial success handling
- Useful for washout periods (start, warning, end)

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Invalid hours/minutes rejected
   - Past dates rejected
   - Invalid weekdays rejected

2. **Edge Cases Handled**
   - Midnight boundary for quiet hours
   - Same-day vs next-day scheduling
   - Critical notification override
   - Quiet hours disabled state

3. **Error Handling**
   - Custom NotificationError class
   - Specific error codes
   - Detailed error messages
   - Graceful degradation

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { notificationScheduler, quietHoursManager } from './services/notifications';

// Configure quiet hours
await quietHoursManager.setQuietHours(
  { hour: 22, minute: 0 }, // 10 PM
  { hour: 7, minute: 0 } // 7 AM
);

// Schedule a daily reminder at 11 PM (during quiet hours)
const id = await notificationScheduler.schedule({
  title: 'Daily reminder',
  body: 'Log your symptoms',
  data: { type: 'daily_reminder' },
  trigger: {
    type: 'daily',
    hour: 23, // 11 PM
    minute: 0,
    repeats: true,
  },
});

// Notification will automatically be adjusted to 7:15 AM
// The notification data will include:
// - originalTime: "2024-10-29T23:00:00.000Z"
// - adjustedTime: "2024-10-30T07:15:00.000Z"
// - wasAdjusted: true
```
