# NotificationService Implementation Notes

## Task 4: Implement NotificationService Core Functionality

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 4 from the personalized notifications spec.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ 4.1 Create Permission Management Methods

Implemented the following methods in `NotificationService.ts`:

- **`requestPermission()`**: Requests notification permission from the user using Expo Notifications API
  - Maps Expo permission status to our `PermissionStatus` type
  - Updates the notification preferences store with status and timestamp
  - Handles errors and throws `NotificationError` with appropriate error codes
  - Requirements: 7.1, 7.2

- **`checkPermission()`**: Queries current notification permission status
  - Checks permission without requesting
  - Updates store if status has changed
  - Returns current permission status
  - Requirements: 7.2, 7.4

- **`openSettings()`**: Opens device settings to allow user to grant permission
  - Platform-specific implementation (iOS uses `app-settings:`, Android uses `openSettings()`)
  - Provides clear path for users to enable notifications after denial
  - Requirements: 7.3, 7.5

### ✅ 4.2 Implement Basic Notification Scheduling

Implemented the following methods:

- **`schedule(input: ScheduleNotificationInput)`**: Schedules a notification with trigger configuration
  - Checks permission before scheduling
  - Converts our trigger format to Expo's trigger format
  - Supports date, daily, and weekly triggers
  - Tracks scheduled notifications in AsyncStorage
  - Returns notification ID for later cancellation
  - Requirements: 1.1, 9.1, 9.2

- **`cancel(notificationId: string)`**: Cancels a specific notification
  - Removes from Expo's scheduled notifications
  - Removes from our tracking storage
  - Requirements: 9.2

- **`cancelAll()`**: Cancels all scheduled notifications
  - Clears all notifications from Expo
  - Clears all tracking data
  - Requirements: 9.2

- **`cancelNotificationsByType(type: NotificationType)`**: Cancels notifications by type
  - Filters tracked notifications by type
  - Cancels matching notifications
  - Useful for disabling specific notification categories

- **`getScheduledNotifications()`**: Retrieves all scheduled notifications
  - Returns array of `ScheduledNotification` objects
  - Includes metadata like scheduled time, trigger, and data

**Notification ID Tracking:**

- Implemented AsyncStorage-based tracking system
- Stores notification metadata including ID, type, scheduled time, and trigger
- Supports querying and filtering scheduled notifications
- Automatically cleans up canceled notifications

### ✅ 4.3 Implement Notification Response Handlers

Implemented the following methods:

- **`onNotificationReceived(handler)`**: Sets up listener for notifications received while app is foregrounded
  - Tracks notification delivery in history
  - Calls custom handler for app-specific logic
  - Returns subscription that can be removed
  - Requirements: 9.4

- **`onNotificationResponse(handler)`**: Sets up listener for notification taps
  - Tracks notification actions (opened, dismissed, button actions)
  - Calls custom handler for deep linking and action handling
  - Returns subscription that can be removed
  - Requirements: 9.4, 10.3

- **`getLastNotificationResponse()`**: Gets the last notification response
  - Useful for handling deep links when app is launched from notification
  - Returns null if no notification launched the app
  - Requirements: 9.4

- **`handleDeepLink(response)`**: Handles deep linking to relevant screens
  - Maps notification types to screen names and parameters
  - Supports all notification types (daily reminder, dose reminder, washout, test start)
  - Returns screen and params for navigation
  - Requirements: 9.4

**History Tracking:**

- Implemented delivery tracking in AsyncStorage
- Implemented action tracking (opened, dismissed, button actions)
- Stores last 100 delivery and action records
- Supports querying history by date range
- Tracks related entity IDs for linking notifications to app data

## Architecture Decisions

### Singleton Pattern

- Used singleton pattern for `NotificationService` to ensure single instance across app
- Provides `getInstance()` static method
- Exported as `notificationService` for convenience

### Error Handling

- Created custom `NotificationError` class with error codes
- Graceful error handling with console logging
- Non-critical operations (history tracking) don't throw errors

### Storage Strategy

- Used AsyncStorage for notification tracking (local-only)
- Separate storage keys for scheduled notifications, deliveries, and actions
- Automatic cleanup to prevent storage bloat (last 100 records)

### Integration with Preferences Store

- Automatically updates permission status in Zustand store
- Reads preferences for permission checks
- Maintains single source of truth for permission state

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- `src/services/notifications/NotificationService.ts` - Main service implementation
- `src/services/notifications/USAGE_EXAMPLE.md` - Usage documentation
- `src/services/notifications/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - This file

### Modified:

- `src/services/notifications/index.ts` - Added exports for NotificationService

## Dependencies

- `expo-notifications` - Core notification functionality
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local storage
- `react-native` - Platform detection and Linking API
- `zustand` - State management (via notificationPreferencesStore)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test permission request flow
   - Test scheduling with different trigger types
   - Test cancellation logic
   - Test deep link mapping

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test permission flow with store updates
   - Test scheduling and tracking
   - Test notification response handling

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test on real iOS and Android devices
   - Test permission request UI
   - Test notification delivery
   - Test action buttons
   - Test deep linking

## Next Steps

The following tasks build on this implementation:

- **Task 5**: Implement NotificationScheduler with quiet hours support
- **Task 6**: Implement protocol-specific notification scheduling
- **Task 7**: Implement AdherenceAnalyzer for adaptive notifications
- **Task 8**: Implement notification history tracking (partially done)
- **Task 9**: Build notification settings UI

## Known Limitations

1. **User ID**: Currently uses placeholder 'current_user' - needs integration with auth context
2. **History Storage**: Uses AsyncStorage - may need migration to Appwrite for cloud sync
3. **Batch Operations**: No retry logic for failed operations yet
4. **Platform Differences**: Some features may behave differently on iOS vs Android

## Requirements Coverage

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- ✅ 1.1 - Daily reminder scheduling
- ✅ 7.1 - Permission request with explanation
- ✅ 7.2 - Permission status storage
- ✅ 7.3 - Settings guide for denied permission
- ✅ 7.4 - Permission status change detection
- ✅ 7.5 - Re-enable instructions
- ✅ 9.1 - Native notification scheduling
- ✅ 9.2 - Background/closed app delivery
- ✅ 9.4 - Deep linking on notification tap
- ✅ 10.3 - Action tracking in history

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliant
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Error handling with custom error types
- ✅ Singleton pattern for service
- ✅ Async/await for all async operations
- ✅ Platform-specific implementations where needed
- ✅ No diagnostics or type errors
