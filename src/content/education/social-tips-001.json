    "content": "# Dining Out During FODMAP Testing\n\n## Planning Ahead\n\nCall the restaurant in advance and ask about ingredient lists. Many restaurants are happy to accommodate dietary needs when given notice.\n\n## Communication Strategies\n\nBe clear and confident when explaining your dietary needs. You don't need to go into medical details - simply state what you can and cannot eat.\n\n## Safe Menu Choices\n\nLook for grilled proteins, steamed vegetables, and rice-based dishes. These are typically safe options that can be modified to fit your needs.\n\n## Bringing Your Own\n\nDon't hesitate to bring your own low-FODMAP condiments or sides if needed. Most restaurants understand and appreciate guests who take their health seriously.",
