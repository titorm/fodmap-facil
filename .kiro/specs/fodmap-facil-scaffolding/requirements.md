# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for scaffolding the "fodmap-facil" mobile application using Expo. The system shall provide a complete project structure with TypeScript, EAS Build, code quality tools, navigation, theming, internationalization, and Supabase integration. The scaffolding shall establish a solid foundation for developing a FODMAP diet tracking application.

## Glossary

- **Expo_App**: The React Native application built using the Expo framework
- **EAS**: Expo Application Services for building and deploying the application
- **Design_Tokens**: Reusable design values (colors, spacing, typography) defined in the theme system
- **Navigation_System**: The routing mechanism using Expo Router with stack and tab navigators
- **Theme_System**: The color scheme management system supporting light and dark modes
- **i18n_System**: The internationalization system for multi-language support
- **Supabase_Client**: The configured client for connecting to Supabase backend services
- **CI_Pipeline**: Continuous Integration workflow using GitHub Actions

5. THE Expo_App SHALL include an /app directory for Expo Router file-based routing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want tab-based navigation with five main sections, so that I can easily access different parts of the application

7. THE Navigation_System SHALL support stack navigation within each tab

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to support light and dark themes, so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Theme_System SHALL define Design_Tokens for colors, spacing, and typography
2. THE Theme_System SHALL provide separate color palettes for light mode and dark mode
3. WHEN the device color scheme changes, THEN THE Theme_System SHALL automatically switch between light and dark themes
4. THE Theme_System SHALL expose theme values through a centralized theme configuration
5. THE Expo_App SHALL apply the system color scheme by default on initial load

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to support Portuguese and English languages, so that I can use the app in my preferred language

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE i18n_System SHALL support Portuguese (pt-BR) as the default language
2. THE i18n_System SHALL support English (en) as an alternative language
3. THE i18n_System SHALL include initial translation keys for onboarding screens
4. THE i18n_System SHALL provide a mechanism to switch languages at runtime
5. THE i18n_System SHALL store language files in a structured format within /src/i18n/locales

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Supabase client configuration, so that I can integrate backend services for authentication and data storage

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Expo_App SHALL include a Supabase_Client configuration file at src/lib/supabase.ts
2. THE Supabase_Client SHALL initialize using environment variables for API URL and anonymous key
3. THE Supabase_Client SHALL be ready for authentication and database operations
4. THE Expo_App SHALL document required Supabase environment variables in .env.example

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks, so that I can maintain consistent code standards across the project

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer executes `npm run lint`, THEN THE Expo_App SHALL run ESLint without errors
2. WHEN the developer executes `npm run test`, THEN THE Expo_App SHALL run Jest tests and all tests SHALL pass
3. THE Expo_App SHALL include npm scripts for formatting code with Prettier
4. THE Expo_App SHALL include npm scripts for type checking with TypeScript

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline configuration, so that code quality checks run automatically on every commit
