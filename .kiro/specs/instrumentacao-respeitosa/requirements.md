# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines requirements for a privacy-respecting analytics instrumentation system for the FODMAP FÃ¡cil application. The system will track minimal, essential user events to understand product usage while maintaining strict privacy standards through opt-in consent, anonymization, and zero personally identifiable information (PII) collection.

## Glossary

- **Analytics System**: The software component responsible for collecting, processing, and transmitting usage events
- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence that is tracked for analytics purposes
- **Opt-in**: A consent mechanism where users must explicitly agree to analytics tracking before any data collection begins
- **Anonymization**: The process of removing or obfuscating identifying information from collected data
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual
- **Global Opt-out Switch**: A user-accessible control that completely disables all analytics tracking
- **Session ID**: A temporary, anonymous identifier for a single app usage session
- **User ID**: An anonymous, randomly generated identifier that persists across sessions but contains no PII

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want to explicitly opt-in to analytics tracking, so that I maintain control over my data sharing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analytics System initializes, THE Analytics System SHALL verify user consent status before collecting any events
2. IF no consent has been granted, THEN THE Analytics System SHALL prevent all event collection and transmission
3. THE Analytics System SHALL provide a consent prompt that clearly explains what data will be collected and why
4. WHEN a user grants consent, THE Analytics System SHALL persist the consent decision locally
5. THE Analytics System SHALL allow users to revoke consent at any time through the Global Opt-out Switch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple way to disable all analytics tracking, so that I can stop data collection immediately if I change my mind

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Analytics System SHALL provide a Global Opt-out Switch accessible through application settings
2. WHEN the Global Opt-out Switch is activated, THE Analytics System SHALL immediately cease all event collection
3. WHEN the Global Opt-out Switch is activated, THE Analytics System SHALL discard any queued events that have not been transmitted
4. WHILE the Global Opt-out Switch is active, THE Analytics System SHALL not initialize tracking components
5. THE Analytics System SHALL persist the opt-out state across application restarts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track essential user journey events, so that I can understand how users interact with core features

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the onboarding_complete event when users finish onboarding
2. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the test_started event when users begin a reintroduction test
3. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the dose_logged event when users record a food dose
4. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the symptom_logged event when users log symptoms
5. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the washout_started event when users initiate a washout period
6. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the report_exported event when users export reports
7. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the paywall_viewed event when users see premium features
8. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL track the paywall_purchased event when users complete a purchase

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my analytics data to be completely anonymous, so that my personal information remains private

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Analytics System SHALL generate a random, anonymous User ID that contains no PII
2. THE Analytics System SHALL not collect user names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct identifiers
3. THE Analytics System SHALL not collect device identifiers such as IMEI, MAC address, or advertising IDs
4. THE Analytics System SHALL not collect precise location data or IP addresses
5. THE Analytics System SHALL use session-based identifiers that reset with each app launch
6. WHERE health data is referenced in events, THE Analytics System SHALL use categorical or aggregated values only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API for tracking events, so that I can easily instrument the application without complex integration

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Analytics System SHALL provide a track method that accepts an event name and optional properties
2. THE Analytics System SHALL validate event names against the approved event list before processing
3. THE Analytics System SHALL automatically enrich events with anonymous context such as timestamp and session ID
4. THE Analytics System SHALL queue events locally when network connectivity is unavailable
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Analytics System SHALL transmit queued events in chronological order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want clear documentation of analytics policies, so that users and regulators understand our data practices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Analytics System SHALL include documentation in the README explaining what data is collected
2. THE Analytics System SHALL include documentation explaining how data is anonymized
3. THE Analytics System SHALL include documentation listing all tracked events and their purposes
4. THE Analytics System SHALL include documentation explaining user consent and opt-out mechanisms
5. THE Analytics System SHALL include documentation confirming no PII is collected

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want analytics to fail gracefully, so that tracking errors do not impact the user experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF an event tracking operation fails, THEN THE Analytics System SHALL log the error without throwing exceptions
2. IF the analytics backend is unavailable, THEN THE Analytics System SHALL queue events locally for later transmission
3. THE Analytics System SHALL implement exponential backoff for failed transmission attempts
4. THE Analytics System SHALL discard events older than 7 days from the local queue
5. THE Analytics System SHALL limit the local event queue to 1000 events maximum

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see what analytics data has been collected about me, so that I can verify my privacy is protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE consent is granted, THE Analytics System SHALL provide a debug view showing recent events
2. THE Analytics System SHALL display the anonymous User ID in the debug view
3. THE Analytics System SHALL show the current consent status in the debug view
4. WHERE the app is in development mode, THE Analytics System SHALL log events to the console
5. THE Analytics System SHALL not expose the debug view in production builds unless explicitly enabled
