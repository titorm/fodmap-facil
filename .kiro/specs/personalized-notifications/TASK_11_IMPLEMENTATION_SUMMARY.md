# Task 11 Implementation Summary: Integrate Notifications with Existing Features

## Overview

Successfully integrated the notification system with existing features across the FODMAP Fácil application. This integration ensures that notifications are automatically managed based on user actions and protocol state changes.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 11.1 Integrate with Symptom Logging ✅

**File Modified:** `src/shared/hooks/useSymptomLogger.ts`

**Implementation:**

- Added notification service integration to the `onSuccess` callback of the symptom logging mutation
- Automatically cancels daily reminder for today when symptoms are logged (Requirement 1.2)
- Tracks symptom logging for adherence analysis (Requirement 6.1)
- Updates adherence score after logging to adjust notification frequency (Requirement 6.1)

**Key Features:**

- Non-blocking integration - errors don't prevent symptom logging
- Automatic adherence score updates
- Smart daily reminder cancellation

### 11.2 Integrate with Test Wizard ✅

**File Modified:** `src/features/test-wizard/hooks/useTestWizard.ts`

**Implementation:**

1. **Dose Reminder Scheduling:**
   - Added `useEffect` hook to automatically schedule dose reminders when test step is loaded
   - Schedules reminders for pending and in-progress test steps (Requirement 2.2)
   - Includes food name and portion size in notifications

2. **Dose Reminder Cancellation:**
   - Integrated into `confirmConsumptionMutation` to cancel reminders when dose is marked as taken (Requirement 2.3)
   - Tracks dose timing for adherence analysis (Requirement 6.2)

3. **Washout Notification Scheduling:**
   - Integrated into `completeDayMutation` to schedule washout notifications after test completion (Requirement 3.1)
   - Automatically calculates washout period (3 days after test completion)
   - Schedules start, warning, and end notifications

**Key Features:**

- Automatic scheduling based on test step state
- Smart cancellation when doses are consumed
- Seamless washout period transition

### 11.3 Integrate with Protocol State Management ✅

**File Modified:** `src/shared/hooks/useProtocolRuns.ts`

**Implementation:**

1. **Protocol Pause Handling:**
   - Cancels all test start reminders when protocol is paused (Requirement 4.4)
   - Prevents notification spam during protocol breaks

2. **Protocol Resume Handling:**
   - Re-enables test start reminders when protocol is resumed (Requirement 4.5)
   - Fetches all pending test steps and schedules reminders for each
   - Maintains protocol momentum after breaks

3. **Protocol State Change Handling:**
   - Schedules test start reminders when protocol becomes active (Requirement 4.1)
   - Tracks previous status to detect state transitions
   - Updates schedules dynamically based on protocol state

**Key Features:**

- State-aware notification management
- Automatic reminder scheduling for pending tests
- Clean pause/resume behavior

### 11.4 Add Notification Indicators to Dashboard ✅

**Files Created/Modified:**

- Created: `src/shared/components/atoms/NotificationIndicator.tsx`
- Modified: `src/shared/components/atoms/index.ts`
- Modified: `src/features/journey/screens/JourneyScreen.tsx`
- Modified: `src/features/reintroduction/screens/ReintroductionHomeScreen.tsx`

**Implementation:**

1. **NotificationIndicator Component:**
   - Shows badge count for pending actions
   - Displays alert when notifications are disabled (Requirement 7.3)
   - Shows sync status for notification preferences
   - Tappable to navigate to notification settings

2. **Dashboard Integration:**
   - Added to JourneyScreen (main dashboard)
   - Added to ReintroductionHomeScreen
   - Positioned prominently at the top of content
   - Auto-refreshes every minute

**Key Features:**

- Visual feedback for notification status
- Pending action count badge
- Sync status indicator
- Accessibility support
- Conditional rendering (only shows when relevant)

## Technical Highlights

### Error Handling

- All notification integrations use try-catch blocks
- Errors are logged but don't block primary operations
- Graceful degradation when notification service is unavailable

### Performance

- Non-blocking async operations
- Minimal impact on existing functionality
- Efficient state updates

### User Experience

- Seamless integration with existing flows
- No additional user actions required
- Smart, context-aware notifications
- Clear visual feedback

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 1.2 ✅

"WHEN the user logs symptoms for the current day, THE Notification System SHALL cancel the scheduled reminder for that day"

- Implemented in useSymptomLogger hook

### Requirement 2.2 ✅

"WHEN the scheduled dose time arrives, THE Notification System SHALL deliver a notification with the food name and dose amount"

- Implemented in useTestWizard hook with automatic scheduling

### Requirement 2.3 ✅

"IF the user marks the dose as consumed, THEN THE Notification System SHALL cancel any pending reminders for that dose"

- Implemented in confirmConsumptionMutation

### Requirement 3.1 ✅

"WHEN a Washout Period begins, THE Notification System SHALL deliver a notification informing the user of the washout start and expected duration"

- Implemented in completeDayMutation

### Requirement 4.1 ✅

"WHEN a new Test Step is available to start, THE Notification System SHALL deliver a notification within 2 hours of availability"

- Implemented in useUpdateProtocolRun hook

### Requirement 4.4 ✅

"WHERE the user has paused their protocol, THE Notification System SHALL NOT deliver test start reminders"

- Implemented in useUpdateProtocolRun hook

### Requirement 4.5 ✅

"WHEN the user resumes their protocol, THE Notification System SHALL re-enable test start notifications"

- Implemented in useUpdateProtocolRun hook

### Requirement 6.1 ✅

"WHEN the user logs symptoms for 7 consecutive days without reminders, THE Notification System SHALL reduce daily reminder frequency to every other day"

- Adherence tracking implemented in all integration points

### Requirement 6.2 ✅

"WHEN the user consistently takes doses on time for 5 consecutive tests, THE Notification System SHALL disable pre-dose reminders (30 minutes before)"

- Dose timing tracking implemented in confirmConsumptionMutation

### Requirement 7.3 ✅

"IF the user denies notification permission, THEN THE Notification System SHALL provide in-app alternatives (dashboard alerts, badges)"

- Implemented via NotificationIndicator component

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Symptom Logging Flow:**
   - Log symptoms and verify daily reminder is cancelled
   - Check adherence score updates

2. **Test Wizard Flow:**
   - Start a test and verify dose reminders are scheduled
   - Mark dose as taken and verify reminders are cancelled
   - Complete day 3 and verify washout notifications are scheduled

3. **Protocol State Flow:**
   - Pause protocol and verify test start reminders are cancelled
   - Resume protocol and verify reminders are re-enabled

4. **Dashboard Indicators:**
   - Deny notification permission and verify alert appears
   - Check badge count updates with pending actions
   - Verify sync status indicator appears during sync

## Next Steps

The notification system is now fully integrated with the application's core features. Future enhancements could include:

1. More granular adherence tracking
2. Additional notification types for specific events
3. Enhanced dashboard analytics
4. Notification history visualization
