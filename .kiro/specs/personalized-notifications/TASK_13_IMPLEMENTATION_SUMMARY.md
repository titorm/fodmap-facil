# Task 13 Implementation Summary: Notification Action Buttons

## Overview

Successfully implemented notification action buttons that allow users to interact with notifications without opening the app. This includes "Mark Taken" and "Snooze" actions for dose reminders, and "Log Now" action for daily reminders.

## Implementation Details

### Subtask 13.1: Configure Notification Categories

**File Modified:** `src/services/notifications/NotificationConfig.ts`

- Updated `setupNotificationCategories()` function to properly configure all notification categories
- Added action buttons for dose reminders:
  - "Mark Taken" (identifier: `mark-taken`)
  - "Snooze 15min" (identifier: `snooze`)
- Added action button for daily reminders:
  - "Log Now" (identifier: `log-now`)
- Added action button for test start reminders:
  - "Start Test" (identifier: `start-test`)
- Added washout category (no actions needed)
- All categories use consistent naming with underscores (e.g., `dose_reminder`, `daily_reminder`)
- Added proper options for each action button (opensAppToForeground, isDestructive, isAuthenticationRequired)

**Requirements Satisfied:**

- Requirement 2.4: Dose reminders with "Mark Taken" and "Snooze" actions
- Requirement 2.4: Daily reminders with "Log Now" action

### Subtask 13.2: Implement Action Handlers

**New File Created:** `src/services/notifications/NotificationActionHandlers.ts`

Implemented a comprehensive action handler system with the following features:

#### Core Functionality

1. **NotificationActionHandlers Class**
   - Singleton pattern for app-wide access
   - Context-based configuration for navigation and callbacks
   - Handles all notification action button responses

2. **Action Handler Methods**
   - `handleMarkTaken()`: Marks dose as taken and cancels remaining reminders
   - `handleSnooze()`: Reschedules dose reminder for 15 minutes later
   - `handleLogNow()`: Opens symptom logging screen
   - `handleStartTest()`: Opens test start screen
   - `handleDefaultAction()`: Handles taps on notification body (deep linking)

3. **Action Tracking**
   - All actions are tracked in notification history
   - Integrates with NotificationHistoryRepository
   - Tracks action types: 'dose_marked_taken', 'snoozed', 'symptom_logged', 'opened'

#### Context Management

The action handlers use a context system to access:

- Navigation object for deep linking
- `onTestStepUpdate` callback for updating test steps
- `onSymptomLogOpen` callback for custom symptom log behavior

**File Modified:** `src/services/notifications/useNotificationSetup.ts`

- Updated hook to accept optional configuration for action handlers
- Integrated NotificationActionHandlers with notification response listener
- Handles notifications that launch the app
- Sets up action handler context during initialization

**File Modified:** `src/services/notifications/index.ts`

- Added exports for NotificationActionHandlers
- Exported singleton instance `notificationActionHandlers`

**Documentation Created:** `src/services/notifications/ACTION_HANDLERS_USAGE.md`

Comprehensive usage guide covering:

- Setup instructions
- Action handler details
- Notification data structure requirements
- Testing strategies
- Troubleshooting tips
- Best practices

**Requirements Satisfied:**

- Requirement 2.4: Handle "Mark Taken" action to update test step
- Requirement 2.4: Handle "Snooze" action to reschedule notification
- Requirement 2.4: Handle "Log Now" action to open symptom logging screen
- Requirement 10.3: Track actions in notification history

## Integration Points

### With Existing Services

1. **NotificationService**
   - Uses `cancelDoseReminders()` to cancel reminders after marking dose as taken
   - Uses `snoozeDoseReminder()` to reschedule snoozed notifications
   - Uses `handleDeepLink()` for default action navigation
   - Uses `markNotificationAsActioned()` to track actions in history

2. **NotificationHistoryRepository**
   - Tracks all notification actions
   - Records action type and timestamp
   - Links actions to related entities

### With App Components

The action handlers integrate with the app through:

1. **Navigation**: Passed via context to enable deep linking
2. **Test Step Updates**: Callback function to update test steps when dose is marked as taken
3. **Symptom Logging**: Callback or navigation to open symptom logging screen

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useNotificationSetup } from './services/notifications';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

function App() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  useNotificationSetup({
    navigation,
    onTestStepUpdate: async (testStepId, updates) => {
      await testStepRepository.update(testStepId, updates);
    },
    onSymptomLogOpen: () => {
      console.log('Opening symptom log');
    },
  });

  return <YourAppContent />;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Dose Reminder Actions**
   - Schedule a dose reminder
   - Tap "Mark Taken" button
   - Verify test step is updated and reminders are cancelled
   - Schedule another dose reminder
   - Tap "Snooze 15min" button
   - Verify notification reappears after 15 minutes

2. **Daily Reminder Actions**
   - Schedule a daily reminder
   - Tap "Log Now" button
   - Verify app opens to symptom logging screen

3. **Test Start Actions**
   - Schedule a test start reminder
   - Tap "Start Test" button
   - Verify app opens to test start screen

### Automated Testing

Consider adding tests for:

- Action handler context setup
- Each action handler method
- Action tracking in history
- Error handling for missing context

## Known Limitations

1. **Platform Differences**
   - Action button behavior may differ between iOS and Android
   - iOS supports up to 4 action buttons, Android supports up to 3
   - Button styling is platform-specific

2. **Context Requirements**
   - Action handlers require proper context setup to function
   - Missing context will log warnings but won't crash the app
   - Navigation must be ready before handling actions

3. **Background Limitations**
   - Some actions (like "Mark Taken") work without opening the app
   - Other actions (like "Log Now") require opening the app
   - Background execution time is limited by the OS

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Actions**
   - "View Details" for washout notifications
   - "Reschedule" for test start reminders
   - "Dismiss" for all notification types

2. **Action Feedback**
   - Show toast notifications when actions complete
   - Provide haptic feedback on action tap
   - Display confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

3. **Analytics**
   - Track action button usage rates
   - Analyze which actions are most effective
   - Identify patterns in user behavior

4. **Customization**
   - Allow users to customize action button labels
   - Support for custom action handlers
   - Configurable action button order

## Verification Checklist
