# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes comprehensive testing infrastructure and reliability measures for the FODMAP Facil application. The system will include visual component testing via Storybook, extensive automated test coverage (engine, hooks, critical screens), API mocking with MSW, and CI/CD pipeline integration to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Glossary

- **Storybook**: A development environment and UI component explorer for building, documenting, and testing UI components in isolation
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: An API mocking library that intercepts requests at the network level for testing purposes
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **Detox**: An end-to-end testing framework for React Native applications
- **CI Pipeline**: Continuous Integration automated workflow that runs tests and quality checks on code changes
- **Coverage Report**: A metric showing the percentage of code executed during test runs
- **AppWrite**: The backend service used by the application for data persistence and authentication
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases grouped by functionality or component
- **Critical Components**: UI components essential to core user workflows (SymptomSlider, DoseCard, ProgressHeader)
- **Engine**: The FODMAP reintroduction logic engine that determines test sequences and tolerance levels

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Storybook configured for critical UI components, so that I can develop and test components in isolation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide a Storybook configuration at `/.storybook/*` with React Native Web support
2. THE System SHALL include story files for SymptomSlider component with all interaction states
3. THE System SHALL include story files for DoseCard component with all dose levels and states
4. THE System SHALL include story files for ProgressHeader component with various progress percentages
5. WHEN a developer runs the Storybook server, THE System SHALL display all component stories with interactive controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the FODMAP engine, so that I can ensure the core business logic is reliable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL achieve a minimum of 90% code coverage for all engine modules in `src/engine/fodmapEngine/*`
2. THE System SHALL include unit tests for sequence generation logic
3. THE System SHALL include unit tests for tolerance calculation algorithms
4. THE System SHALL include unit tests for washout period determination
5. THE System SHALL include unit tests for symptom scoring and analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests for custom React hooks, so that I can verify state management and side effects work correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL include unit tests for useAuth hook covering authentication flows
2. THE System SHALL include unit tests for useProtocolRuns hook covering protocol state management
3. THE System SHALL include unit tests for useSymptomEntries hook covering symptom logging
4. THE System SHALL include unit tests for useTestSteps hook covering test progression
5. THE System SHALL include unit tests for useNotificationSetup hook covering notification scheduling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests for critical user screens, so that I can ensure key user journeys function correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL include integration tests for DiaryScreen covering symptom entry workflows
2. THE System SHALL include integration tests for TestDayScreen covering dose recording
3. THE System SHALL include integration tests for ReportsScreen covering data visualization
4. THE System SHALL include integration tests for NotificationSettingsScreen covering preference management
5. WHEN critical screens are tested, THE System SHALL verify navigation flows and data persistence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MSW configured to mock AppWrite API calls, so that I can run tests without a live backend

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide MSW handlers that intercept all AppWrite database operations
2. THE System SHALL provide MSW handlers that intercept all AppWrite authentication operations
3. THE System SHALL provide realistic mock data matching the AppWrite schema
4. WHEN tests execute API calls, THE System SHALL return mocked responses without network requests
5. THE System SHALL allow test-specific mock data overrides for edge case testing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want convenient npm scripts for running tests, so that I can easily execute tests during development and in CI

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide a `test:watch` script that runs Jest in watch mode for development
2. THE System SHALL provide a `test:ci` script that runs all tests with coverage reporting for CI pipelines
3. THE System SHALL provide a `test:engine` script that runs only engine tests
4. THE System SHALL provide a `test:hooks` script that runs only hook tests
5. THE System SHALL provide a `test:integration` script that runs only integration tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a CI pipeline that automatically runs tests and linting, so that I can catch issues before merging code

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL execute all test suites on every pull request
2. THE System SHALL execute ESLint checks on every pull request
3. THE System SHALL execute TypeScript type checking on every pull request
4. WHEN tests complete, THE System SHALL generate and attach a coverage report to the pull request
5. IF any test fails or coverage drops below thresholds, THEN THE System SHALL mark the CI check as failed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optional lightweight e2e tests with Detox, so that I can verify critical user flows end-to-end when needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE Detox is configured, THE System SHALL provide e2e tests for the onboarding flow
2. WHERE Detox is configured, THE System SHALL provide e2e tests for creating a symptom entry
3. WHERE Detox is configured, THE System SHALL provide e2e tests for starting a reintroduction test
4. WHERE Detox is configured, THE System SHALL provide a `test:e2e` script to run end-to-end tests
5. THE System SHALL document Detox setup as optional with clear installation instructions
