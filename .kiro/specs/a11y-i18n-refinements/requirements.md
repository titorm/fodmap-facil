# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive accessibility (a11y) and internationalization (i18n) refinements for the FODMAP Fácil mobile application. The goal is to ensure the application is fully accessible to users with disabilities, properly internationalized for Portuguese (pt-BR) and English (en-US) speakers, and provides empathetic, user-friendly microcopy throughout the user experience. This includes reviewing all components for accessibility compliance, organizing translation strings into logical namespaces, and ensuring no hardcoded strings exist outside the i18n system.

## Glossary

- **Application**: The FODMAP Fácil mobile application built with React Native and Expo
- **Component**: A reusable UI element in the React Native application
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: The practice of making applications usable by people with disabilities
- **Screen Reader**: Assistive technology that reads on-screen content aloud for visually impaired users
- **Focus Order**: The sequence in which interactive elements receive keyboard or screen reader focus
- **Dynamic Font Scaling**: The ability for text to resize based on user system preferences
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The process of designing software to support multiple languages and regions
- **Namespace**: A logical grouping of related translation strings
- **Microcopy**: Short, user-facing text elements like labels, buttons, error messages, and empty states
- **Hardcoded String**: Text directly embedded in code rather than externalized to translation files
- **Lighthouse**: An automated tool for measuring web and mobile application quality metrics
- **ARIA Roles**: Accessibility attributes that define the purpose of UI elements for assistive technologies
- **Touch Target**: The interactive area of a button or control element
- **Empty State**: UI displayed when no data is available in a section
- **Confirmation Dialog**: A modal or alert that asks users to confirm an action

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want all interactive elements to be properly labeled and accessible to screen readers, so that I can navigate and use the application independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application renders any interactive element, THE Application SHALL provide an appropriate accessibilityRole attribute

4. WHEN THE Application renders any button or control, THE Application SHALL ensure the touch target meets the minimum size of 44x44 points
5. WHERE an element has dynamic state, THE Application SHALL provide accessibilityState attributes reflecting the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who relies on screen readers, I want the focus order to follow a logical sequence, so that I can navigate through screens efficiently without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application renders a screen, THE Application SHALL order focusable elements in a logical top-to-bottom, left-to-right sequence
2. WHEN THE Application displays a modal or dialog, THE Application SHALL trap focus within the modal until dismissed
3. WHEN THE Application navigates to a new screen, THE Application SHALL set initial focus to the first meaningful element
4. IF THE Application contains grouped elements, THEN THE Application SHALL maintain focus order within each group before moving to the next group

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with low vision, I want text to scale according to my system font size preferences, so that I can read content comfortably without straining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application renders any Text component, THE Application SHALL enable the allowFontScaling property
2. WHEN THE Application renders any Text component, THE Application SHALL set maxFontSizeMultiplier to a value between 1.5 and 2.5
3. WHEN THE Application renders text at increased font sizes, THE Application SHALL ensure layouts adapt without text truncation or overlap
4. WHEN THE Application renders critical UI elements, THE Application SHALL maintain usability at font sizes up to 200 percent of default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Portuguese-speaking user, I want the entire application interface in Portuguese (pt-BR), so that I can understand all features and content in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application detects the device language as Portuguese, THE Application SHALL display all UI text in Portuguese (pt-BR)
2. WHEN THE Application renders any user-facing text, THE Application SHALL retrieve the text from the i18n translation system
3. THE Application SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded user-facing strings outside the i18n system
4. WHEN THE Application formats dates or numbers, THE Application SHALL use locale-appropriate formatting for Portuguese (pt-BR)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an English-speaking user, I want the entire application interface in English (en-US), so that I can understand all features and content in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application detects the device language as English, THE Application SHALL display all UI text in English (en-US)
2. WHEN THE Application renders any user-facing text, THE Application SHALL retrieve the text from the i18n translation system
3. THE Application SHALL provide complete English translations for all features and content
4. WHEN THE Application formats dates or numbers, THE Application SHALL use locale-appropriate formatting for English (en-US)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want translation strings organized into logical namespaces, so that I can easily find and update specific translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL organize translation strings into namespaces by feature area
2. THE Application SHALL group common strings used across features in a shared namespace
3. THE Application SHALL use consistent naming conventions for translation keys within each namespace
4. THE Application SHALL document the namespace structure in the i18n configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user experiencing an error or empty state, I want to see empathetic and helpful messages, so that I understand what happened and what I can do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application displays an error message, THE Application SHALL provide a clear explanation of what went wrong
2. WHEN THE Application displays an error message, THE Application SHALL suggest actionable next steps for resolution
3. WHEN THE Application displays an empty state, THE Application SHALL provide encouraging microcopy explaining why the state is empty
4. WHEN THE Application displays an empty state, THE Application SHALL provide a clear call-to-action to populate the state
5. WHEN THE Application requests user confirmation, THE Application SHALL use empathetic language that respects user decisions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want button labels and titles to be clear and action-oriented, so that I know exactly what will happen when I interact with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Application renders a button, THE Application SHALL use action verbs in the button label
2. WHEN THE Application renders a button that performs a destructive action, THE Application SHALL clearly indicate the consequence
3. WHEN THE Application renders navigation elements, THE Application SHALL use descriptive labels that indicate the destination
4. THE Application SHALL maintain consistent terminology for similar actions across different screens

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify accessibility compliance using automated tools, so that I can identify and fix accessibility issues before release.
