## Accessibility Features Implemented

### Screen Reader Support

✅ All interactive elements have meaningful labels
✅ All buttons have descriptive hints
✅ State changes are announced via live regions
✅ Charts have comprehensive text descriptions
✅ Loading states are properly announced
✅ Error states use assertive announcements

### Visual Accessibility

✅ High contrast mode toggle for charts
✅ Color-coded elements also use patterns/borders in high contrast mode
✅ Text remains readable in all modes
✅ Proper color contrast ratios maintained

### Keyboard/Focus Management

✅ All interactive elements are focusable
✅ Tab order follows logical flow
✅ Modal traps focus appropriately
✅ Selected states are properly indicated

### Dynamic Content

✅ Loading states announced
✅ Error states announced immediately
✅ Success messages announced
✅ Progress updates announced
✅ Data changes reflected in accessibility tree

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing with Screen Readers

#### iOS (VoiceOver)

1. Enable VoiceOver: Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver
2. Navigate through Reports screen
3. Verify all elements are announced correctly
4. Test chart descriptions
5. Test state change announcements
6. Test PDF export flow

#### Android (TalkBack)

1. Enable TalkBack: Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack
2. Navigate through Reports screen
3. Verify all elements are announced correctly
4. Test chart descriptions
5. Test state change announcements
6. Test PDF export flow

### Automated Testing

- Use `@testing-library/react-native` to verify accessibility props
- Test that all interactive elements have labels
- Test that state changes trigger announcements
- Verify ARIA roles are correctly applied

### User Testing

- Test with actual users who rely on screen readers
- Gather feedback on announcement clarity
- Verify chart descriptions are understandable
- Ensure navigation flow is logical

## Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance

✅ **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All charts have text alternatives
✅ **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Proper semantic structure with roles
✅ **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality available via keyboard/screen reader
✅ **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Logical focus order maintained
✅ **2.4.6 Headings and Labels**: Descriptive labels for all elements
✅ **3.2.4 Consistent Identification**: Consistent labeling across components
✅ **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: All elements have proper name, role, and value
✅ **4.1.3 Status Messages**: Status changes announced via live regions

### React Native Accessibility Best Practices

✅ Use of `accessible={true}` for grouping
✅ Proper `accessibilityRole` for semantic meaning
✅ `accessibilityLabel` for descriptive names
✅ `accessibilityHint` for action descriptions
✅ `accessibilityState` for current state
✅ `accessibilityLiveRegion` for dynamic content
✅ `accessibilityValue` for progress indicators

## Known Limitations

1. **SVG Charts**: Screen readers cannot interact with individual data points in SVG charts. This is mitigated by providing comprehensive text descriptions.

2. **Chart Complexity**: Very detailed charts may have long accessibility descriptions. This is acceptable as it provides complete information to screen reader users.

3. **Platform Differences**: Some accessibility features may behave slightly differently on iOS vs Android due to platform-specific screen reader implementations.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Interactive Chart Elements**: Consider adding interactive data point selection with individual announcements
2. **Customizable Descriptions**: Allow users to adjust verbosity of chart descriptions
3. **Audio Cues**: Add optional audio feedback for state changes
4. **Haptic Feedback**: Enhance with haptic patterns for different actions
5. **Voice Commands**: Integrate voice control for common actions

## Conclusion

The Reports functionality now provides a fully accessible experience for users with disabilities. All interactive elements are properly labeled, state changes are announced, and charts have comprehensive text descriptions. The implementation follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines and React Native accessibility best practices.

Users relying on screen readers can now:

- Navigate through all report sections
- Understand chart data through text descriptions
- Receive announcements for loading, errors, and success states
- Export PDFs with progress updates
- Toggle high contrast mode for better visibility

This implementation ensures that the FODMAP reintroduction app is inclusive and usable by all users, regardless of their abilities.
