# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a real-time reporting system with PDF export functionality for the FODMAP reintroduction app. The system will provide users with comprehensive tolerance profiles, test history, symptom timelines, and the ability to export professional reports in Portuguese (pt-BR) format.

## Glossary

- **Reporting System**: The module responsible for generating, displaying, and exporting user tolerance and symptom data
- **Tolerance Profile**: A categorization of FODMAP groups as tolerated, moderate, or trigger based on test results
- **Test History**: A chronological record of all reintroduction tests performed by the user
- **Symptom Timeline**: A temporal visualization of symptom entries correlated with food tests
- **PDF Export Service**: The component that generates printable/shareable PDF documents from report data
- **High Contrast Mode**: An accessibility feature that enhances visual distinction in charts and graphs
- **Disclaimer**: Legal and medical notices included in exported reports

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my tolerance profile by FODMAP group, so that I can understand which foods I tolerate well and which trigger symptoms

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Reports screen, THE Reporting System SHALL display tolerance categories (tolerated/moderate/trigger) for each tested FODMAP group
2. THE Reporting System SHALL calculate tolerance levels based on symptom severity data from completed tests
3. THE Reporting System SHALL display visual indicators (colors, icons) for each tolerance category
4. WHERE a FODMAP group has not been tested, THE Reporting System SHALL indicate "not tested" status
5. THE Reporting System SHALL update tolerance profiles in real-time when new test data is recorded

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my complete test history, so that I can track my reintroduction progress over time

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL display a chronological list of all reintroduction tests with dates and food items
2. WHEN the user selects a test from history, THE Reporting System SHALL display detailed results including doses, symptoms, and tolerance outcome
3. THE Reporting System SHALL sort test history with most recent tests first
4. THE Reporting System SHALL display test status (completed, in progress, abandoned)
5. WHERE test data includes notes, THE Reporting System SHALL display user-entered notes in the test details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a timeline of my symptoms, so that I can identify patterns and correlations with food tests

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL display symptom entries on a temporal axis correlated with test dates
2. THE Reporting System SHALL visualize symptom severity using graphical representations (charts or graphs)
3. WHEN the user interacts with the timeline, THE Reporting System SHALL display detailed symptom information for selected dates
4. THE Reporting System SHALL highlight symptom entries that occurred during active test periods
5. THE Reporting System SHALL support filtering symptom timeline by date range

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my reports as PDF, so that I can share them with my healthcare provider or keep them for my records

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL provide an export button on the Reports screen
2. WHEN the user triggers PDF export, THE PDF Export Service SHALL generate a document containing tolerance profile, test history, and symptom timeline
3. THE PDF Export Service SHALL format the document in Portuguese (pt-BR) language
4. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include medical and legal disclaimers in the exported document
5. WHEN PDF generation completes, THE Reporting System SHALL open the native share dialog for iOS and Android

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PDF report to have a professional layout, so that it is suitable for sharing with medical professionals

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF Export Service SHALL use a clean, professional layout with proper spacing and typography
2. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include a header with report title and generation date
3. THE PDF Export Service SHALL organize content into clearly labeled sections
4. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include page numbers on multi-page reports
5. THE PDF Export Service SHALL use appropriate medical terminology in Portuguese

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want charts to support high contrast mode, so that I can clearly distinguish data in visualizations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL provide a high contrast mode toggle for chart visualizations
2. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled, THE Reporting System SHALL use colors with WCAG AAA contrast ratios
3. THE Reporting System SHALL use patterns or textures in addition to colors for data distinction
4. THE Reporting System SHALL maintain chart readability in both standard and high contrast modes
5. THE Reporting System SHALL persist the user's high contrast preference across sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see basic metrics in my report, so that I can quickly understand my overall progress

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL calculate and display total number of tests completed
2. THE Reporting System SHALL calculate and display percentage of FODMAP groups tested
3. THE Reporting System SHALL calculate and display average symptom severity across all tests
4. THE Reporting System SHALL display the date range of the reintroduction protocol
5. THE Reporting System SHALL display the number of tolerated, moderate, and trigger foods identified

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle PDF generation errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong if export fails

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF PDF generation fails, THEN THE Reporting System SHALL display an error message in Portuguese explaining the failure
2. IF device storage is insufficient, THEN THE Reporting System SHALL inform the user about storage requirements
3. IF network connectivity is required but unavailable, THEN THE Reporting System SHALL inform the user to retry when online
4. THE Reporting System SHALL log PDF generation errors for debugging purposes
5. WHEN PDF generation fails, THE Reporting System SHALL allow the user to retry the export operation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want charts to be lightweight and performant, so that the app remains responsive even with large datasets

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reporting System SHALL render charts within 500 milliseconds for datasets up to 100 data points
2. THE Reporting System SHALL use SVG or Skia-based rendering for optimal performance
3. THE Reporting System SHALL implement virtualization for large symptom timelines
4. THE Reporting System SHALL cache rendered chart components when data has not changed
5. THE Reporting System SHALL display loading indicators during chart rendering for datasets exceeding 100 points

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want disclaimers in the PDF report, so that I understand the limitations and proper use of the information

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include a disclaimer stating the report is for informational purposes only
2. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include a disclaimer advising users to consult healthcare professionals
3. THE PDF Export Service SHALL include a disclaimer that the app is not a substitute for medical advice
4. THE PDF Export Service SHALL display disclaimers in clear, readable Portuguese text
5. THE PDF Export Service SHALL position disclaimers prominently in the PDF footer or final page
