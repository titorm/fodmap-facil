# Task 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the ReportsScreen with complete tab navigation, data fetching, and all three report tabs (Tolerance, History, Timeline).

## Completed Subtasks

### 4.1 Create ReportsScreen component structure ✅

- Set up tab navigation with three tabs: Tolerance, History, Timeline
- Added high contrast mode toggle in header with AsyncStorage persistence
- Added PDF export button in header (placeholder for task 5)
- Implemented loading state with spinner
- Implemented error state with retry button
- Added pull-to-refresh functionality

### 4.2 Implement Tolerance tab ✅

- Renders MetricsSummary component with tolerance metrics
- Renders ToleranceChart component with FODMAP group data
- Passes highContrastMode state to chart
- Handles empty state when no tests are completed
- Shows loading indicator during data fetch

### 4.3 Implement History tab ✅

- Renders TestHistoryList component with test data
- Implemented pull-to-refresh functionality (inherited from ScrollView)
- Handles empty state when no tests exist
- Added filter options: All, Completed, In Progress
- Filter buttons with active state styling

### 4.4 Implement Timeline tab ✅

- Renders SymptomTimelineChart component with symptom data
- Added date range filter controls (placeholder UI for future implementation)
- Passes highContrastMode state to chart
- Handles empty state when no symptoms are logged
- Shows loading indicator during data fetch

### 4.5 Implement data fetching with React Query ✅

Created `useReportData` hook with:

- Individual hooks for tolerance, history, timeline, metrics, and full report
- Combined hook that fetches all data simultaneously
- 5-minute cache time with 2-minute stale time
- Automatic refetch on pull-to-refresh
- Proper loading and error state handling
- Cache invalidation utilities

### 4.6 Implement high contrast mode toggle ✅

- Toggle switch in screen header
- Stores preference in AsyncStorage with key `@reports_high_contrast_mode`
- Passes highContrastMode state to all chart components
- Persists preference across sessions
- Loads preference on component mount

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

1. `src/features/reports/hooks/useReportData.ts` - React Query hooks for data fetching
2. `src/features/reports/hooks/index.ts` - Hook exports

### Modified:

1. `src/features/reports/screens/ReportsScreen.tsx` - Complete implementation with all tabs

## Key Features

### Data Management

- Uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Automatic cache invalidation after 5 minutes
- Refetch on pull-to-refresh
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages in Portuguese

### UI/UX

- Tab navigation with visual indicators
- Loading states for each tab
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Error states with retry functionality
- Pull-to-refresh on all tabs
- High contrast mode for accessibility

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements have accessibility labels
- Accessibility hints for better screen reader support
- Accessibility states for selected tabs and filters
- High contrast mode for visual impairments

## Integration Points

### Dependencies:

- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching and caching
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Preference persistence
- `react-native-svg` - Chart rendering (via components)
- `date-fns` - Date formatting (via components)

### Services:

- `ReportService` - Data aggregation from repositories
- All existing repository services (via ReportService)

### Components:

- `MetricsSummary` - Displays summary metrics
- `ToleranceChart` - Bar chart for tolerance profile
- `TestHistoryList` - Scrollable list of test history
- `SymptomTimelineChart` - Line chart for symptom timeline

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with no data (empty states)
2. Test with partial data (some tabs empty)
3. Test with full data (all tabs populated)
4. Test pull-to-refresh functionality
5. Test high contrast mode toggle and persistence
6. Test filter functionality in History tab
7. Test error states and retry functionality
8. Test on different screen sizes
9. Test with screen reader (accessibility)

## Next Steps

Task 5 will implement:

- PDF generation service
- HTML markup generation
- PDF export functionality
- Native share dialog integration

## Notes

- Date range filter in Timeline tab is a placeholder UI - full implementation can be added later
- PDF export button is present but not functional yet (will be implemented in task 5)
- Test detail navigation from History tab is logged but not implemented (can be added later)
- All Portuguese translations are inline - can be moved to i18n files if needed
