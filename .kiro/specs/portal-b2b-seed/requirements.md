# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the B2B Portal seed implementation. The Portal System is a Next.js/React application that provides healthcare professionals with secure access to patient data and reports. This initial seed establishes the foundation for a B2B platform with authentication, patient listing, and read-only report viewing capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Portal System**: The Next.js web application that provides the B2B interface
- **Healthcare Professional**: A registered user who accesses the Portal System to view patient data
- **Supabase Auth**: The authentication service that manages Healthcare Professional sessions
- **Patient Record**: A mock data entry representing a patient in the system
- **Report View**: A read-only interface displaying patient report details
- **Permission Layer**: The authorization mechanism controlling access to Portal System features

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Healthcare Professional, I want to authenticate using Supabase, so that I can securely access the Portal System

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Healthcare Professional navigates to the Portal System root, THE Portal System SHALL display a sign-in interface
2. WHEN a Healthcare Professional submits valid credentials, THE Portal System SHALL authenticate via Supabase Auth and grant access
3. WHEN a Healthcare Professional submits invalid credentials, THE Portal System SHALL display an error message and prevent access
4. WHEN an authenticated Healthcare Professional session expires, THE Portal System SHALL redirect to the sign-in interface
5. WHERE a Healthcare Professional is authenticated, THE Portal System SHALL display a sign-out option

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Healthcare Professional, I want to view a list of patients, so that I can select which patient's data to review

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated Healthcare Professional navigates to /patients, THE Portal System SHALL display a list of Patient Records
2. THE Portal System SHALL render Patient Records using mock data for the initial seed implementation
3. WHEN a Healthcare Professional clicks on a Patient Record, THE Portal System SHALL navigate to the corresponding Report View
4. THE Portal System SHALL display patient name and identifier for each Patient Record in the list
5. WHERE no Patient Records exist, THE Portal System SHALL display an empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Healthcare Professional, I want to view detailed patient reports, so that I can review patient information in a read-only format

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated Healthcare Professional navigates to /reports/[id], THE Portal System SHALL display the Report View for the specified patient
2. THE Portal System SHALL render report data in a read-only format preventing modifications
3. WHEN the specified report identifier does not exist, THE Portal System SHALL display a not-found message
4. THE Portal System SHALL display a navigation option to return to the patient list
5. THE Portal System SHALL use mock data for report content in the initial seed implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Healthcare Professional, I want the portal to have a consistent layout, so that I can navigate efficiently between different sections

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Portal System SHALL display a navigation header on all authenticated pages
2. THE Portal System SHALL provide navigation links to the patient list from the header
3. WHILE a Healthcare Professional is on any page, THE Portal System SHALL display the current user information in the header
4. THE Portal System SHALL apply consistent styling and branding across all pages
5. THE Portal System SHALL be responsive and functional on desktop browsers with minimum width of 1024 pixels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a basic permission layer defined, so that the portal can be extended with role-based access control

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Portal System SHALL implement a permission checking mechanism for route access
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access protected routes, THE Portal System SHALL redirect to the sign-in interface
3. THE Portal System SHALL define a basic permission structure that can accommodate future role-based rules
4. THE Portal System SHALL verify authentication status before rendering protected page content
5. THE Portal System SHALL provide a foundation for extending permissions without requiring architectural changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the portal to run locally with minimal setup, so that I can develop and test features efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Portal System SHALL run on a local development server using standard Next.js commands
2. THE Portal System SHALL include configuration for connecting to Supabase Auth
3. THE Portal System SHALL provide clear documentation for local setup in a README file
4. WHEN a developer runs the development server, THE Portal System SHALL be accessible at localhost with a specified port
5. THE Portal System SHALL use environment variables for configuration without hardcoded credentials
