# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a continuous delivery pipeline for the FODMAP FÃ¡cil mobile application using Expo Application Services (EAS) Build and GitHub Actions. The system enables automated builds for development, preview, and production environments, with secure environment variable management and automated submission to TestFlight and Google Play Internal Testing.

## Glossary

- **EAS Build System**: Expo Application Services build infrastructure that compiles React Native applications for iOS and Android
- **Build Profile**: A named configuration in eas.json that defines build settings for a specific environment (dev, preview, production)
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: An automated CI/CD pipeline that runs on GitHub's infrastructure
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values (API keys, endpoints) that vary between environments
- **TestFlight**: Apple's beta testing platform for iOS applications
- **Internal Testing Track**: Google Play's closed testing channel for Android applications
- **Build Badge**: A visual indicator in README showing the current build status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure EAS Build profiles for different environments, so that I can build the application with appropriate settings for development, preview, and production

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EAS Build System SHALL provide three distinct build profiles named "development", "preview", and "production"
2. WHEN a development build is requested, THE EAS Build System SHALL include development tools and use development environment variables
3. WHEN a preview build is requested, THE EAS Build System SHALL create a distributable build suitable for internal testing
4. WHEN a production build is requested, THE EAS Build System SHALL create an optimized build suitable for app store submission
5. WHERE the iOS platform is selected, THE EAS Build System SHALL configure appropriate provisioning profiles and bundle identifiers for each profile

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage environment variables securely across different build profiles, so that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the repository

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment Management System SHALL store sensitive environment variables using Expo's secure environment variable system
2. THE Environment Management System SHALL provide a template file (.env.example) that documents all required environment variables without exposing actual values
3. WHEN a build is executed, THE EAS Build System SHALL inject the appropriate environment variables for the selected profile
4. THE Environment Management System SHALL prevent committing actual .env files to version control through .gitignore configuration
5. THE Environment Management System SHALL support Kiro secrets integration for local development environment variables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute a single command to create a preview build, so that I can quickly generate test builds without manual configuration

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build Command Interface SHALL provide a single command that triggers a preview build for both iOS and Android platforms
2. WHEN the preview build command is executed, THE EAS Build System SHALL automatically select the preview profile configuration
3. THE Build Command Interface SHALL display build progress and provide a shareable URL upon completion
4. THE Build Command Interface SHALL complete the preview build process within 20 minutes under normal conditions
5. IF the build fails, THEN THE EAS Build System SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and creates preview builds, so that code quality is verified before deployment

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL execute linting checks on every pull request
2. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL execute the complete test suite on every pull request
3. WHEN all tests pass on the main branch, THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL automatically trigger a preview build
4. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL fail the CI pipeline if linting errors are detected
5. THE GitHub Actions Workflow SHALL fail the CI pipeline if any test fails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated submission to TestFlight and Internal Testing, so that beta testers receive new builds without manual intervention

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a production build completes successfully, THE Submission System SHALL automatically submit the iOS build to TestFlight
2. WHEN a production build completes successfully, THE Submission System SHALL automatically submit the Android build to Google Play Internal Testing
3. THE Submission System SHALL require explicit approval before submitting to production tracks
4. THE Submission System SHALL provide submission status notifications through GitHub Actions
5. IF submission fails, THEN THE Submission System SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a release checklist documented in the README, so that I can follow a consistent process for releasing new versions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Release Documentation SHALL provide a step-by-step checklist for creating releases
2. THE Release Documentation SHALL include version bumping procedures following semantic versioning
3. THE Release Documentation SHALL document the process for creating and pushing git tags
4. THE Release Documentation SHALL explain how to monitor build status and troubleshoot common issues
5. THE Release Documentation SHALL include rollback procedures for failed releases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a build status badge in the README, so that I can quickly see the current CI/CD pipeline status

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build Status Badge SHALL display the current status of the main branch CI/CD pipeline
2. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline is passing, THE Build Status Badge SHALL display a green "passing" indicator
3. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline is failing, THE Build Status Badge SHALL display a red "failing" indicator
4. THE Build Status Badge SHALL link directly to the GitHub Actions workflow runs page
5. THE Build Status Badge SHALL update automatically within 5 minutes of workflow completion
